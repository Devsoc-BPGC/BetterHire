# BetterHire

Throughout this century the Tech Industry has always been a safe harbor for competence and merit. However, the fact that some people feel disenfranchised is not an acceptable situation. We belive that increasing the transparency of the decision making process is key to making sure this is never the case.


### Purpose

BetterHire is a **fair for all** tool meant to remove any kind of **bias(including subconscious bias) during hiring/promotions** in tech companies(specifically for software engineers) that might creep in during candidate interviews on the basis of immutable characteristics and even some mutable characteristics such as accent.

It is a tool for **true employee empowerment** forcing companies to become transparent with their decisions in front of their employees and other applicants.


### Current Goal

We are focusing mainly on building a software oriented hiring pipeline that promotes both objectivity and transparency in the company's hiring process.

The process for tech hiring followed by most companies is normally:
* Resume Shortlisting
* Coding Round
* Multiple Technical Interviews
* HR Interviews
